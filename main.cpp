/*
 *  QuadTree needs:
 *      Nodes
 *      Input type (an interface including AABB?)
 *      Some way to return info
 *      Type for AABB axis alined bouning box -> created AABB template class
 *      Enum for 4 quadrants -> dones
 *  Things to decide:
 *      Precision used to store AABB coordinates -> used template
 *      Does tree hold copy of values or just pointers to values that exist separatly
 *          - Keeping copy doesn't allow to return info about overlaping objects without using indices
 *          - Keeping ordinary pointers is not safe
 *          - Shared pointers are a bit slower -> done
 *      Is QuadTree class just an interface
 *          - If it is an interface then there is no need to create new project each time some I make new version of tree.
 *             However how often new version has same API? Well, one day I will learn to make proper interfaces that stay same
 * `            -> made QuadTree as an abstract class
 *      Where to create and hold data structure responsible for quad tree elements
 *          - Inside visualisation widget -> feels wrong cuz of strong coupling. However
 *              this widget is algorithm specific and therefore is not reusable.
 *          - Make small stuct responsible for this and place it into this header ->
 *              Looks as most resonable thing to do right now
 *      How quad tree and element holder should related to each other
 *          - They can be just 2 separate objects -> ugly cuz what if it is needed not only perform quad tree related operations
 *              but also something like nearest neighbor etc. -> Then there would be multiple objects interacting with element holder ->
 *              Considering that element holder is specific to element type all objects can be moved in it
 *          - Quad tree can be member of element holder -> less ugly
 *          - Quad tree be turned into data structure that actually stores all data on its own ->
 *              guess it depends on goald of quad tree. Quad tree needs to work with arbitrary object
 *              that inherit QuadTreeElement so there is no way to store this objects inside
 *      Purpose of quad tree
 *          - Finding all overlaping objects
 *          - Returning all objects in range
 *          - Doing all above on arbitrary objects that inherit QuadTreeElement
 *      Where quad tree and element holder should be located
